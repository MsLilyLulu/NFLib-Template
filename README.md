A bare-bones template using the NightFox Lib for making NDS games.

# Notice

First of all, I cloned [PolyMars's Snake-DS repo](https://github.com/PolyMarsDev/Snake-DS) and removed all contents so it's just the basic things needed for a basic project, so it's only a bare-bones main.cpp file and the NFLib folder. Secondly, this project requires [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) to compile the code. Additionally, NFLib is already integrated into the repo.


tldr; I'm dum and can't get the included NFLib template to work ðŸ˜”, [install devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started).
